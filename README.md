# outdoor-odyssey
A mobile application of the Outdoor Odyssey at Roaring Run Mentor Manual.
This project was originally started as a proof of concept for personal use,
but has evolved into a way to hopefully help others keep in touch with the
Outdoor Odyssey mentoring program, while also generating revenue to donate 
back to the organization. Ideas or recommendations are greatly appreciated!
